    "description": "Non-Fungible Species is a collection based on endangered species to raise funds to help them. We want you to feel that you are helping a specific living being, so there are as many NFTs as individuals of each species. Apart from funding the projects, you will have access to an exclusive Vivatopia Discord server with the rest of the community and an invitation to an annual event with the developers of the projects and other holders. Also, you could gain a COAP certificate for you or your company. The funds will be for the projects of organizations like Global Nature. Please, visit https://vivatopia.es/categorias/nft-de-especies-en-peligro-de-extincion/ for more information.",
